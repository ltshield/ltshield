# Hello!
My name is Logan Shields, and I am currently a student at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am passionate about working in the overlap between mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence, particularly within the realm of biomedical technologies. My goal is to work on projects that develop innovative solutions to improve the quality of life of individuals facing physical challenges.

# Experience / Projects
While pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering, I have also had the opportunity to work on certain research and class projects centered around Software Development, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Network Science Theory and Applications.

## Class Work
*BYU CS 240 - Summer 2025*
### [Chess Server](https://github.com/ltshield/chess) ♟️ : Chess Server

#### *What Learned*
This project gave me experience with developing a full-stack application in Java with networked client-server architecture, a command-line client, a SQL and local database, a server to manage users and games, and shared modules for implementing chess logic, rules, and game state management. Also learned about and implemented HTTP communications between client and server as well as websocket communication between clients when in-game.

## ParaPal: AI-Powered Essay Grading & Data Insights Tool for K-12 Teachers
*September 2024 - August 2025*

### [ParaPal Demo](https://github.com/ltshield/parapal-demo) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltshield/parapal-demo/parapal-2.png) : ParaPal Overview and Demo Video

#### *What Learned*
This project enabled me to work with a team to identify a need and develop a product that meets that need, emphasizing the development of a tool that works to solve that problem over anything else. Gained experience developing agentic LLM workflows that can interpret natural-language teacher queries, write and execute Python code dynamically, and return validated insights — focusing heavily on reliability, context preservation, and execution safety. Designed modular grading pipelines that support dynamic rubric mapping, multi-standard scoring, and auditability (every automated decision is traceable with highlighted evidence). Pivoted the product direction mid-build after user testing revealed that essay grading automation was far more valuable than data analysis alone — coordinated team buy-in and re-scoped roadmap without losing development velocity. Ran live user studies with educators, collecting real-time feedback and transforming criticism into rapid roadmap iterations. Most of all, learned how to balance engineering ambition with product discipline by focusing on “what removes the most friction for the user the fastest” rather than over-abstracting of complicating the product.

## Human-Centered Machine Intelligence Lab with Dr. Michael Goodrich 
*April 2024 - Present*

### [BT_Sim](https://github.com/ltshield/bt_sim) 🐜 : Grammatical Evolution in a Virtual Swarm Environment

#### *What Learned*

This project further developed my understanding of the concept of grammatical evolution through rigorous trial and error. I perused many an academic research paper in search of ideas and/or methods that I could implement to improve my simulation while also familiarizing myself with the field. A project of this size taught me a lot about good coding practices to implement in future projects. I became more familiar with the benefits of git, learned useful debugging practices, the importance of clean and readable/understandable code with inlaid comment explanations, and even strengthened effective communication skills with my team members as we all individually tried our hand at the project.

### [Communal_Pool_Sim](https://github.com/ltshield/communal_pool_sim) 🤝 : Simulated Community Cooperation for Escaping Poverty

#### *What Learned*

This project introduced me to economic theory as applied to communities in poverty. It reflected some work that had been done previously by researchers looking into a possible intervention for increasing accountability and cooperation across a community for the purpose of helping the community as a whole to escape poverty. I learned various visualization methods and became aware of a few of the metrics used in social sciences for measuring inequality in a community, such as the Gini coefficient.

<!--
maybe include a comment about how we discovered that we were doing two different kinds of grammatical evolution and got to learn from that
